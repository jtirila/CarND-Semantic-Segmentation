# Semantic Segmentation Project

This is a brief summary of my Semantic Segmentatin Project implementation.

The full original description by Udacity can be [read here](README_udacity.md).


My implementation relies heavily, in addition to the classroom notes and the project walkthrough, 
to the paper 
[Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf) 
by Jonathan Long, Evan Shelhamer and Trevor Darrell. 

In addition, I consulted 
[Jeremy Shannon's implementation](https://github.com/jeremy-shannon/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation/) for some details. 
Specifically, I picked the kernel initialization code and some hints about the train_nn 
function from Jeremy. The rest of the implementation was fully my own work.
